H2o library is used which connects to the cluster .All the calculation happen on the clusters.
H2o handles billions of data segments in-memory, even with a little gathering. To make it less complex for non-designers to make complete
informative work procedures, H2O's stage joins interfaces for R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON, and JavaScript, and also an inalienable 
web interface, Flow.H2O was worked close by (and on top of) Hadoop and Start Bunches and consistently passes on inside minutes. H2O 
incorporates numerous machine learning algorithm, such as generalized linear modeling (linear regression, logistic regression, etc.),
Na√Øve Bayes, principal components analysis, time series, k-means clustering, and others H2O additionally implements best-in-class 
algorithm at scale, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Deep Learning. Customers can build thousands of models and compare 
the results to get the best predictions . Some Features of H2O 
a) It is a scalable in-memory platform for machine learning. 
b) It is free and open source. 
c) It is cross-platform and supports R, Python, Scala, and Java. 
d) Last but not least, it has a dedicated team of developers continually making
