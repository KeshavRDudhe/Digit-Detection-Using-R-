# Digit-Detection-Using-R-
In this project , machine learning ,deep learning tools and technique were used 
to Analyze the MNIST dataset .MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards 
and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is 
commonly used for training various image processing systems. The images 
were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, 
and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the   28x28 
field. Different types of models are tried and tested .The data is the pixel values 
of black and white hand written images .The value ranges from 0-255  .Which 
tells about the brightness of pixel .Deep learning model is used to classify an    
Image .h2o library is used which connects to the cluster .All the calculation 
happen on the clusters. While classifying an image understanding of model is 
necessary . Automatic digit recognition is of popular interest today. Deep 
learning techniques    makes it possible for object recognition in image data. 
Perceiving the digit has turned into a fundamental part as far as certifiable 
applications. Since, digits are composed in various styles in this way to 
distinguish the digit it is important to perceive and arrange it with the assistance 
of machine learning methods. This exploration       depends on supervised 
learning vector quantization neural system arranged under counterfeit artificial 
neural network. The pictures of digits are perceived, prepared and tried. After 
the system is made digits are prepared utilizing preparing dataset vectors and 
testing is connected to the pictures of digits which are separated to each other 
by fragmenting the picture and resizing the digit picture as needs be for better 
precision.
